<h4> Breadth First Search Algorithm</h4>
<p>BFS is a powerful graph traversal technique used to systematically explore all nodes of a graph or tree. It plays a crucial role in various applications, including network routing, shortest path finding</p>

<b>Traversal Technique</b>
<p> BFS explores a graph in a breadth-wise manner. It starts at a specified node (often the root) and systematically visits all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.</p>
<b>Queue Data Structure</b>
<p>The queue maintains the order in which nodes are visited, ensuring that nodes at the current level are explored before moving to deeper levels.</p>
<b>Time and Space Complexity</b>
<p>The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is also O(V) due to the storage requirements of the queue and visited set.</p>
<b>Properties of BFS:</b>
<li>Shortest Path Finding</li>
<li>Cycle Detection</li>
<li>Level Order Traversal</li>
<li>Bi-directional Search</li>
