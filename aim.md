The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate and understand the Breadth First Search algorithm by implementing it on a graph. BFS is a graph traversal technique where all nodes at the current level are explored before moving to the next level. This approach facilitates a systematic exploration of a graph or tree structure, ensuring that nodes are visited in a breadth-wise manner, starting from the root or a specified starting point.
